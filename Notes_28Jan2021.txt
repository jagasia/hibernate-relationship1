what is the difference between managed and detached entity
	managed?		(synchronized)	with db record

	i create an object (obj) of Vehicle. Since i have created an object, definitely it is in transient state. 
	(not in sync with a rec in db table)

	session.merge(obj);	//obj moves to persistent state	(sync)


	from local machine to server	(upload)
	from server to local machine	(download)

	if it is in both ways		(sync)


	i say an object created by me (which is in transient state) is also detached entity

	i create an object with primary key value also set. while i use persist() method
	i get error (detached entity)


	session.get()	returns an object (persistent state) is a managed entity
	session.evict()	the object moves to (detached state) is a detached entity
	session.merge()	moves the object to (persistent state) is a managed entity


yesterday:
	java project. 
	add jars
	add hibernate mapping xml files
=======================================
	maven project
	add dependencies to pom.xml
		i) hibernate mapping xml file	(or)	vehicle.hbm.xml	(hibernate mapping xml file)
		ii) annotations to map the entity class, properties to the table, columns	@Entity

	as i always tell, for every configuration we use xml or annotation

	what we are mapping in a xml file???		
		class to a table
		properties to the columns
		id for primary key	

		data types are also mentioned in mapping
		validations like not null, email, range also can be specified in the mapping



	1) add dependencies
		<dependency>
			<groupId>com.oracle.ojdbc</groupId>
			<artifactId>ojdbc8</artifactId>
			<version>19.3.0.0</version>
		</dependency>

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
			<artifactId>hibernate-core</artifactId>
			<version>4.0.1.Final</version>
		</dependency>
	2) hibernate.cfg.xml		file
		here, 
			<mapping resource="vehicle.hbm.xml" />		means we are using xml mapping file
			(instead)
			<mapping class="packagename.Vehicle" />		means we are using annotation mapping



	
Task:
	create or modify the project where, instead of using hbm.xml file, use annotations to map the entity to table


annotations for:
	Table name
	Column name
	Data types		identify annotations to mention the data type in the table
		when we use byte[] for pic, audio, etc. 	
		use @Lob annotation	when we use byte []
	Transient
	Primary key
	GeneratedValue
	
	when there is a primary key - foreign key relationship, 
	relationship annotations:
		@OneToOne
		@OneToMany
		@ManyToOne
		@ManyToMany


	
HQL
	three types of queries:
	i) query			HQL
	ii) named query
	iii) native query

	session.createQuery()		-	Query
	session.createNativeQuery()	-	we write SQL statements 	(not HQL statement)

	what is this named query?
		in the entity class itself, some queries are mentioned using annotation
		so that in DAO, we can execute those queries



	we can do
		filter
		sort
		order by
		join
		sub query
		group by
		having
			

	while executing the queries, we get 
			result
			no of rows affected

	
TasK:
	write a query that retrieves only few columns of the table, with a condition

In Named query, we write the query in the Entity class using @NamedQuery annotation. We do not write query in the DAO class methods. we refer to the name  of the query to execute them.


Task:
	create a named query
	@NamedQueries(  
    {  
        @NamedQuery(  
        name = "findEmployeeByName",  
        query = "from Employee e where e.name = :name"  
        )  
    }  
)  
  
@Entity  

	in DAO:
		get named query and execute
   TypedQuery query = session.getNamedQuery("findEmployeeByName");    
            query.setParameter("name","amit");   
                    
            List<Employee> employees=query.getResultList();  


1) positional parameters
		where v.company=?1
2) named parameters
		where v.company=:company




		Session session = MyConnection.getConnection();
		SQLQuery query = session.createSQLQuery("SELECT * FROM Vehicle");
		List result= query.list();		//list method to execute a select statement. executeUpdate() for DML statements
		for(Object v:result)
		{
			Object []r=(Object[]) v;
			System.out.println(r[0]);
		}



EJB	Enterprise Java Beans	(javax.persistance)
	EJB QL		there was only left outer join

	Entity Manager
		em.persit(obj);		

	Java Persistence API		-	JPA

JPA Framework




Task:
	identify the need for Criteria Query


Pagination:	Lets discuss after some time


Task:
	Identify the methods equivalent to the various operators used in rdbms
	ex:
		like
		and
		or
		between
	Note: Use Criteria, Criterion, Restrictions 

sample:
	public void read4()
	{
		Session session = MyConnection.getConnection();
		Criteria c = session.createCriteria(Vehicle.class);
		Criterion c1 = Restrictions.like("company", "Suz%");
		Criterion c2 = Restrictions.like("company", "Toy%");
		c.add(Restrictions.or(c1, c2));
		c.addOrder(Order.desc("company"));
		c.addOrder(Order.asc("name"));
		List<Vehicle> vehicles= c.list();
		for(Vehicle v:vehicles)
			System.out.println(v);
	}

class Song
{
	id
	name
	List<Artist> artistList;
}

class Artist
{
	id
	name
	List<Song> songList;
}


Relationships:

class Book
{
	id
	title
	price
	Author author;		//this is not authorId	but an object of Author
}

in table in db
	Book table contains		id, title, price, authorId (fk) but we want Author object instead of aid

class Author
{
	id
	fname
	lname
	List<Book> bookList;		
}

Book and Author			Many to One


in traditional approach:	SELECT QUERY

SELECT * FROM AUTHOR;
	will produce 		id, fname, lname		author table do not have ref to any book
		1 to many / many to 1 			1 will be a fk in many table
	book table 
		id, title, price, authorId	
	again, using authorid, i have to write a query to find author
	select * from book where authorId=?		returns multiple books. store it in author object as List<Book> bookList

when i fetch a record of author, 
		the corresponding book list is also loaded means (Fetch typeis EAGER)
		only when i refer to getter method of List<Book> means (Fetch type is LAZY)

while updating, 
	we fetch all the value of entity and populate in the user fields, he edit only few data. again we send all data back to db. it was discussed as costly. 
	but hibernate is smart. if no change, it will not transfer those data.
